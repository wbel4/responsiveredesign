      <h2>Chosen Webpage:</h2>

      <h4 id="reason">I chose this <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">webpage</a> as it is one I commonly visit and 
        the UI/UX is noticeably bad for being a “hack news” site.

      <h4>Usability Problems:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>The website does not take up the entire screen on the Desktop version, not using screen real estate as well as possible.</li>
        <li>The Desktop version also seems to have a lot of whitespace on the right side of the listings in conjunction with a very small font size which isn't very readable.</li>
        <li>The navbar seems crammed and doesn't seem the most clickable. It also leaves the screen when scrolling down.</li>
        <li>The login button is easy to miss as it is on its own little island in the navbar.</li>
        <li>The gray text does not contrast enough with the off-white background and a lot of the text is too small to read.</li>
        <li>A clearer division between listings would also help visually separate articles.</li>
      </ul>
